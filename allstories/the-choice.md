	Billy Sepps had a choice to make. Turn right, to walk past the commuter cafes, would be quicker. Turn left, perhaps the better claim, would take him through an elegant curve of cherry blossom trees. His interview was not until 9:30 a.m, so he had time to decide. He cut left, into Savile Row. He would come to learn later, when he was older, when life had pummelled wisdom deep inside him, when choices begat choices and way lead on to way, that it was the trees that drew him left.
		‘Too much poetry in your head, Son,’ his father would say.
		‘Nonsense,’ his grandfather would retort.
	When Dad left, Billy and Grandad filled the void by reading together. They read anything and everything, voraciously. And so it was, Billy Sepps excelled at school and university. And so it was, Billy Sepps landed a prestigious job interview. And so it was, two roads to choose from, Billy Sepps, blue-eyed romantic, decided on the one less travelled by.
	It was one of those crisp spring mornings that demanded optimism, even from a Monday. He’d slept on a friend’s sofa to avoid being late and now, with some time at hand, stopped to check his reflection in the large shop window of Bookers, Gentleman Tailors. He passed judgement on both profiles in turn and posed with jacket closed and then opened. He licked his hand and ran it back through his hair to fix an errant mop of blonde fringe. The suit had been his Grandfather’s, a classic blue double-breasted barathea twill, worn partly for luck but mostly as evidence that something of substance from his family, something good, had survived. Old suits have character and like the old men from whom they are borrowed, often crease and behave as they choose. He tried to remember the feel of his Grandfather’s consoling hugs and conjure his whispered advice into vivid reality.
	’Take your chances, Son. Suck on life’s marrow, open your heart to people, and tell the truth, boy.’
